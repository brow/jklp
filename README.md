jklp is a computer keyboard that is 40%, unsplit, and very column-staggered.

This repository contains the files you need to make a hand-wired jklp and bring it to life.

Compared to keyboards in this category, its distinguishing features are:
* Greater angle between the halves: 20°
*  Greater pinky stagger
* The angle between the halves can be changed without any rewiring, by replacing a single piece of the case
* No glue.


* "40%" means it has about 40% as many keys as full-sized board. Typing a given character sometimes requires pressing a combination of keys.
* "Unsplit" means it resembles a split keyboard in that has a distinct half for each hand, and the halves are angled inward to match the angle of your resting forearms. But it's unsplit because the two halves are joined together.





jklp is pronounced like "jökulhlaup".
